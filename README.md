This is the source code for a Web application that supports Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) testing. This is a kind of
test that is widely used by psychologists for quantifying sleepiness. When we are tired, we will nod off
 for short periods (scientists call it "micro-sleep"). This test is designed to catch those moments if 
they are occurring. They will manifest as a slowing of reflexes.

Usually, testers in studies will have to take a ten-minute test as many as 6 times a day. But I think you can still get interesting 
data even if you only take the test once or twice a day.

When finished, you will be able to:

 * Take anonymous PVT tests.
 * View test results graphed, alongside relevant statistics.
 * Create accounts to save results and analyze trends over time.
 * Export all result data to CSV for your own records and analysis.
 
A trans-development "nightly" build of the website will be available at [pvt.luketurner.org](http://pvt.luketurner.org). (Note that site is the
gh-pages branch of this repository).
